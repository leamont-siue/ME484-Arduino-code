# ME484-Arduino-code

This code was written for SIUE ME484-001, Spring 2020, senior design. The code is written for an arduino integrated into a self-leveling rocket launch stand. It allows an arduino to sense the angle of the launch platform and adjust to "level" horizontal. The code also allows the user to adjust the angle and orientation of the launch rail as desired, up to a maximum 360-degrees of rotation and 15-degree angle of inclination off-vertical.
